Q1)Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
Ans: HTTP1- 1)HTTP1 is not Fast and Reliable enough when compared to HTTP2
       2)It loads a single request for every TCP connection(Hence time consumption is more)
       3)Status codes were used to indicate successful requests and to indicate transmission errors.
       4)User was able to send files other than plain HTML, including scripts and mediawith the help of content-type header
       5)HTTP 1 Can define 16 status codes Whereas the error prompt is not given properly


HTTP2-1)HTTP2 is Fsst and Reliable enough when compared to HTTP1
      2)It avoids network delay by using multiplexing(Hence time consumption is less)
      3)HTTP2 provides a feature called server push that allows the server to send data that the client will need but has not yet requested.
      4)It Underlies semantics of HTTP such as headers, status codes Provides proper message 



Q2)Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
Ans:objects may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs(Which provides the proeprties

 Ways to create an object in javascript are as follows-\

*Object literal
object literal is a comma-separated list of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literals encapsulate data, enclosing it in a tidy package.
var car={id:1 , name:’abc’ , display:function() }

* Object.create()
The method creates a new object, using an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.
using the object literal example as prototype-
var car2 = Object.create(car);
car.id=2;
car.name=’xyz’;

*Object constructor
Useful when we require to create multiple objects of similar type. In this case, a constructor (kind of blueprint) is created and multiple objects can be initialized using the new keyword using the constructor as a wrapper for the newly created objects.
construction function-
function Person(name, age, eye) {
this.Name = name;
this.age = age;
this.eyeColor = eye;
}
creating objects using constructor-
var p1= new Person(“John”, 50, “blue”);
var p2= new Person(“Sally”, 48, “green”);

*Object.assign()
It is used to copy the values and properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It invokes getters and setters since it uses both [[Get]] on the source and [[Set]] on the target.
Input : var obj1 = { a: 10 };
var obj2 = { b: 20 };
var obj3 = { c: 30 };
var new_obj = Object.assign(o1, o2, o3);
console.log(new_obj);
Output : Object { a: 10, b: 20, c: 30 }

*Object.fromEntries
This method transforms a list of key-value pairs into an object.
const entries = new car([
[‘id’, 4],
[‘color’, ‘blue’]
]);
const car1= Object.fromEntries(entries);
console.log(car1);
output: Object { id: 4, color: ‘blue’}
